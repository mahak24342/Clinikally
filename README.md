This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


##  Objective

Build an AutoComplete search field that:
- Fetches suggestions from an API as the user types.
- Displays suggestions in a dropdown.
- Avoids unnecessary API calls.
- Provides a smooth and responsive UI experience.

### ðŸ§  Thought Process

To implement the AutoComplete functionality:

* I used the Fetch API to retrieve data from the provided endpoint (`https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=`).
* Utilized React hooks such as `useState` for managing input and results, and `useEffect` to trigger side effects (API calls).
* Implemented debouncing using `setTimeout` inside `useEffect` to delay API calls until the user pauses typing, improving performance and reducing unnecessary requests.
* Included a cleanup function with `clearTimeout` to cancel previous timeouts on rapid input changes.
* Wrapped the fetch logic inside a `try...catch` block to handle errors gracefully and avoid breaking the UI on failed API responses.

 React hooks:
useState to manage input, results, loading, and dropdown visibility.
useEffect to trigger API calls when input changes.

### . Debouncing for Optimization
- Implemented a 300ms debounce using `setTimeout` inside `useEffect` to delay API requests until the user pauses typing.
- Cleared the timeout on each keystroke to avoid rapid requests.
  
### . Conditional Search
- Triggered the API call only if the input length is 2 or more characters to reduce noise and avoid unnecessary API hits.

### . UI Design
- Used TailwindCSS for styling.
- Displayed results in a dropdown-like container under the search input.
- Added hover effect to dropdown items for better UX.
- Showed a loading indicator while the API call is in progress.
